### What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

- CSS Bootstrap 4: It provides the griding system for mobile first responsive design and set of handy classes and components for faster UI development.
- Vuejs: it's a javascript framework for developing user interface and single page applications
- Axios: it's a promise base javascript package for making HTTP requests
- Moment: It's a javascript package for generating / formatting / reformatting dates


### If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

There are always lots of room for improvements and features. The first thing I like to add is the filter for the itineraries.

### Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

The ui is simple I've tried to use less custom css codes, and also Vuejs makes it even simpler to develop such a page. Cleanness and simplicity makes me happy at all.

### Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

It was simple. The thing is I haven't use bootstrap 4 that much, so I had to search for classes.

### How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

The test was good. The only problem was the CORS issue with the API to retrieve the json data. Because I didn't have access to the back-end to fix it, so I put the data source on project and making request to retrieve it.

There was nothing from the back-end side as the test is for the Full-Stack role.
